    Welcome to my website! <!--If my comically large banner wasn't enough, As you could probably guess,--> My name is Dani! <!--I sometimes make things I want to share with others, and decided that I should keep--> This is a public record<!--/collection--> of what I've made for others to see. <!-- I also have interests! --><br><br>
    
    <!--I love everything early-2000s-esque, especially ToonTown. The Bardyard game for the PS2 is a very close second. Old 3D graphics make me feel very nostalgic., slightly-uncannycoupled with the nostalgia factor make me feel very warm and fuzzy. --> <br><br>

    I am also a Physics student; I love Maths and spend most of my day studying it. It gives some sort of meaning to my otherwise meaningless life.<br><br>
    
    Feel free to message me on Twitter @Daanniii6 or send an email to daanniiionline at gmail dot com.<br><br>

    <!--Warning: Beyond this point lies math/physics talk, you have been warned.--><br><br>
    <!--
    I will eventually add a book-review section to my website for texts I find useful and/or interesting, but for the time being, I'm just going to recommend Arnold's Classical Mechanics and ODE books for providing incredible intuition.
